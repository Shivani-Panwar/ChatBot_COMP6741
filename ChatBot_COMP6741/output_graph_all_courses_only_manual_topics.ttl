 This course introduces the digital geometry modelling pipeline focusing on fundamental data structures and algorithms for digital representation and processing of 3D geometry.  Students  study a wide range of applications and solutions in computer-aided design, engineering, architecture reverse engineering, and medical applications. As triangle meshes are by far the most popular representation for 3D geometry, this course focuses on triangle mesh representations and data structures that enable the programmer to efficiently query and edit geometry. In addition, the course covers spline modelling: Hermite splines, Bezier splines, and B-Splines. A project is required.""" ;

The objective is to depict the problem of environmental quality as an economic problem whose solution demands major changes in economic, political, and legal institutions. Attention is also given to policies of collective environmental actions in which the effective management of common property resources is discussed. The course concludes with a discussion of some broader issues, such as the consistency of improved environmental quality with continued economic and population growth.""" ;

The congeries of experimental movements collectively identified as Modernism, flourishing from prior to World War I until World War II, renegotiated artistic conventions, revived neglected traditions, and turned attention to the primary materials of art (sound, colour, language). In painting emerged a tendency to abstraction, in music a tendency to atonality, and in literature to non-mimetic forms. Experiments abounded in disjunctive, elliptical, impressionistic, allusive, and mythopoeic styles. Avant-garde artists organized into numerous schools, including the Imagists, Surrealists, Dadaists, Constructivists, Futurists, and Vorticists. The literature, often produced by expatriates, was cosmopolitan, elitist, and provocative. Much of the most important work, appropriately enough in an era of female enfranchisement, was written by women. It was also the “Jazz Age,” the nexus of which was the Harlem Renaissance. While the course focuses on the lively cross-fertilization of British and American writing, the international scope of Modernism is also emphasized, as well as its diversity (e.g. in ballet, cinema, music, and painting).""" ;

This course presents the macroscopic mechanical behaviour of continuously distributed solid and fluid materials. This is a fundamental graduate course in the field of mechanical or aerospace engineering, which  covers basic principles of continuum mechanics and their engineering applications. All laws of continuum mechanics are formulated in terms of quantities that are independent of coordinates. Thus, in this course, first the concept of tensors is presented in detail as the linear transformation. This is followed by the formulation of the kinematics of very small and large deformation and the description of stresses and the basic laws of continuum mechanics common to all materials. Finally, constitutive equations governing the behaviours of idealized materials, including the elastic, hyperelastic and viscous materials, are presented as applications of these laws.

 Ce séminaire est une introduction à l’histoire générale de la traduction, notamment (mais non exclusivement) en Occident, ainsi qu’à l’évolution des approches historiographiques. Une vue en coupe est présentée à travers des thématiques permettant de dégager le rôle historique joué par les traducteurs comme acteurs sociaux proches des pouvoirs en place ou critiques de ces pouvoirs. L’accent est mis sur la créativité des traducteurs à certaines époques clés de contacts entre des cultures. Le séminaire peut aborder certains domaines précis de la traduction et des travaux menés à des périodes historiques et dans des aires géographiques données.""" ;

Through lectures, discussions, assignments and field trips, students are introduced to a variety of analytical perspectives that investigate the socio-cultural dynamics that contribute to shaping urban settlements, human-environment interactions and local social networks.""" ;

Prerequisite: IRST 211 and 21 credits in Irish Studies; or permission of the Department. This seminar explores the complex and politically charged relationship between history and memory in modern Ireland in the contexts of politics, popular culture, commemoration practices, and scholarship. Drawing on the insights offered by the interdisciplinary field of memory studies, it explores the interactions between past and present and memory and forgetting by tracing the ways key historical events have been historicized, revised, commemorated, and otherwise remembered (and silenced) over time by nationalists, unionists, “exiles,” and other “communities of memory” in Ireland and among the Irish Diaspora. Possible memory case studies include the 1641 Rebellion; the Williamite War; the 1798 Rising; the Great Famine; the First World War and the events of the Irish Revolution; the Northern Irish “Troubles”; and Church-State institutional abuse in independent Ireland.""" ;

Implications for the practice of leadership are addressed through class discussions. An effort is made to ensure that students do not adopt a myopic view of leadership. Rather, different perspectives on the process of leadership are presented, that make radically different assumptions.

This seminar explores the central concepts and theories in feminist cultural studies, as they inform feminist, post-colonial, queer, and post-structuralist understandings of culture. The focus is on women as cultural producers and subjects in/of various cultural texts (e.g. cinema, visual arts, music, advertising, popular media, feminist writings). The discursive construction of gender, as it is inflected by class, race, sexuality, and location, is examined as well as the ways in which it is used, displayed, imagined and performed in contemporary culture. Students develop practical and analytical skills, posing questions of how particular cultural narratives function within social, political and economic contexts. Students are required to participate in and lead discussions of the readings and to create and/or critique cultural productions.""" ;

This course provides an innovative approach to understanding how psychologists think about the mind and behaviour, ask and answer questions, and collect and interpret evidence to clarify ideas and test hypotheses. Students learn the difference between critical thinking and gullibility. Students also develop skills to identify errors and misrepresentations in information presented in the media and in viewpoints driven by agendas rather than evidence.""" ;

In contrast, social psychology focuses on how behaviour may be influenced by social and contextual factors. Topics may include the many ways of describing the self and others, persuasion, group processes, close relationships, aggression, and prosocial behaviour.""" ;
